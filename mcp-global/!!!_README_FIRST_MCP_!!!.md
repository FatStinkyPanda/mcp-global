# 🚀 MCP-Global Tools Integrated!

I have completed the integration of MCP-global tools, rules, and workflows into the project.

### 🤖 For Fresh AI Agents
Any fresh AI agent can now be brought up to speed simply by being told:
> **"Read `mcp_bootstrap.md` and install mcp-global for this project."**

### ⚡ Automation
I've also added a `/mcp-install` workflow for automation.

### ✅ Verified
Everything has been verified to work. Happy coding!
