# MCP Global Rules

> **AI Agent Enhancement Package** — 53 Scripts | 48 Commands | 6 Git Hooks | Offline-First

MCP Global Rules is a drop-in AI agent enhancement system that installs into any project and gives every AI agent working on it a shared set of tools, memory, code analysis, security scanning, autonomous development workflows, and enforced quality gates. It works completely offline and requires only Python 3.8+.

---

## What Is This?

When an AI agent (Claude, Gemini, GPT-4, local LLM, etc.) works on a project with MCP Global installed, it gains access to:

- **Persistent memory** across sessions — agents remember decisions, file locations, and learned patterns
- **Semantic code search** — find related code by meaning, not just keyword
- **Automated code review** — quality checks enforced at commit time via git hooks
- **Security auditing** — scan for secrets, vulnerabilities, and injection risks before every push
- **Bug prediction** — AI-powered analysis to catch issues before they ship
- **Multi-agent coordination** — agents on different machines collaborate via `mcp comms`
- **Full offline operation** — 90+ bundled wheel files, no internet required

---

## Quick Install

## AI Agent Trigger Commands

Two special trigger words activate predefined autonomous workflows:

### `dev` — Autonomous Development Mode

When you say **"dev"** to your AI agent, it will:

1. Find and load MCP tools automatically
2. Read `README.md` as the single source of truth
3. Run `autocontext` and `recall "project"`
4. Identify the next priority task via `todos`
5. **Implement autonomously** — no human input required
6. Commit progress incrementally, following quality gates

### `go` — Context + Suggestions Mode

When you say **"go"** to your AI agent, it will:

1. Load context and read `README.md`
2. Identify tasks and gaps via `todos`
3. **Stop and present findings** — does NOT make changes
4. List suggested next steps with priority and complexity estimates
5. Wait for your explicit direction

---

## Enforced Quality Gates

Git hooks automatically block operations that fail quality standards:

| Hook | Trigger | Blocks On |
|------|---------|-----------|
| `pre-commit` | Every commit | CRITICAL security issues, code review errors |
| `pre-push` | Every push | Doc coverage < 50%, architecture violations |
| `commit-msg` | Every commit | N/A — enriches context only |
| `post-commit` | Every commit | N/A — updates learning and indexes |
| `post-checkout` | Branch switch | N/A — warms context |
| `post-merge` | After merge | N/A — re-indexes |

---

## Mandatory AI Agent Workflow

AI agents working on MCP-enabled projects MUST follow this workflow:

### Before Making Changes

```bash
python mcp-global-rules/mcp.py autocontext        # Load context
python mcp-global-rules/mcp.py recall "topic"     # Check memory
python mcp-global-rules/mcp.py find "component"   # Find related files
python mcp-global-rules/mcp.py impact file.py     # What could break?
python mcp-global-rules/mcp.py predict-bugs file.py  # Bug prediction
```

### During Development

```bash
python mcp-global-rules/mcp.py docs src/ --write  # Add docstrings
python mcp-global-rules/mcp.py fix src/           # Auto-fix issues
python mcp-global-rules/mcp.py review src/        # Continuous review
```

### Before Committing

```bash
python mcp-global-rules/mcp.py review src/ --strict   # Full review
python mcp-global-rules/mcp.py security src/          # Security audit
python mcp-global-rules/mcp.py deadcode src/          # Remove unused code
python mcp-global-rules/mcp.py coverage src/          # Check doc coverage
```

### Before Pushing

```bash
python mcp-global-rules/mcp.py architecture src/            # Validate structure
python mcp-global-rules/mcp.py profile src/                 # Check complexity
python mcp-global-rules/mcp.py summarize --output SUMMARY.md  # Update context
```

### Record Decisions

```bash
python mcp-global-rules/mcp.py remember "auth_handler" "src/auth.py"
python mcp-global-rules/mcp.py record action "Implemented feature X"
python mcp-global-rules/mcp.py record decision "Chose approach Y because Z"
```

---

## Multi-Agent Coordination

MCP supports multiple AI agents collaborating across machines via the `comms` system.

### Coordination Workflow

```bash
# 1. Check if peer is active before starting
python mcp-global-rules/mcp.py comms status

# 2. Announce your work
python mcp-global-rules/mcp.py comms heartbeat "active" "starting auth refactor"

# 3. Delegate a task to a peer
python mcp-global-rules/mcp.py comms send wizardpanda task "Run security scan on api/"

# 4. Listen for results
python mcp-global-rules/mcp.py comms listen

# 5. Enter autonomous back-and-forth loop
python mcp-global-rules/mcp.py comms collaborate
```

### Model Priority Enforcement

Agents MUST use models in this order:

1. **Gemini Flash** — Primary, default for all tasks
2. **Claude Opus** — Secondary, for complex reasoning
3. **Local LLM** — Fallback, zero-dependency operation

Use `python mcp-global-rules/mcp.py model status` to verify and `model switch` to change.

---

## NSync: Remote Execution Workflow

For tasks that need to run on a remote machine (e.g., WizardPanda / Raspberry Pi):

```bash
# Initialize a new project for remote sync
python mcp-global-rules/mcp.py nsync init-project my_project

# Watch for changes and sync automatically
python mcp-global-rules/mcp.py watch .

# Run a script on the remote machine
python mcp-global-rules/mcp.py nsync run my_project/main.py
```

---

## Dependency & Vendor Packages

### Core Scripts (No Installation Required)

All 53 Python scripts use **stdlib only** — Python 3.8+ standard library. Zero external dependencies for core functionality.

### Bundled Vendor Wheels (Offline-First)

```bash
pip install --no-index --find-links=vendor/python-packages-py311 pylint flake8 black mypy bandit pytest

## Core Principles

These principles are enforced by the system and must be followed by all agents:

1. **Fix Properly, Never Disable** — Always fix issues completely. Never restrict, disable, or reduce capabilities. All integrations must build on what already exists.

2. **README as Single Source of Truth** — `README.md` defines project goals and roadmap. All agent decisions must align with it.

3. **No Emojis in Code** — Emojis in source code cause encoding errors across devices and platforms. Prohibited unless explicitly requested.

4. **Autonomous Collaboration** — Agents must coordinate via `mcp comms` to avoid conflicts. Zero human intervention is the goal.

5. **Model Priority Enforcement** — Gemini Flash first, Claude Opus second, local LLM as fallback. Switch automatically on rate limits.
